No, not that wire (although [The Wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire) is excellent). I'm talking about [Over the Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). I find myself wanting to come to terms with the tools that make modern life possible and suspect that working through these will be step towards that.  

Maybe it's my version of a midlife crisis, and in an earlier time I would've picked up woodworking, or something. I'll start with [bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) and I'll follow the [rules](https://overthewire.org/rules/) During the process I'll try and write about my thought process as I attempt to solve each challenge.

# Meta Commentary

In keeping with the 'teach-thyself' I'm hosting this blog on [Neocites](https://neocities.org/) (and may even pay for it one day, full-time-employment willing!) and cribbing shamelessly from Zach Leatherman's [11ty base blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog). Hopefully, as time passes, less and less will be stock as I get my bearings. A lot has changed since I built my first website on Geocities.
